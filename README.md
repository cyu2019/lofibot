# lofibot

hey boys

This is a small webapp that will accept a 2 or 4 measure 4/4 sample and generate a short lofi hip hop song from it.

It can either be run from the command line or from a gui.
```
pip install pydub
pip install librosa
npm install
node web
```
Then access localhost:8080 in your web browser.

To use from the command line, use:
```
python script.py
